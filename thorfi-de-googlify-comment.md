# De-Googlify Comment by thorfi - Last updated Sep 2025

Background: Google is an advertising company. They make the vast majority of their revenue by harvesting and selling your personal data to advertisers. They have become more and more unethical and sometimes illegal about this activity over time, and show no signs of stopping that trend any time soon. A list of events is well beyond the scope of this document, but I can confirm the trend is decades old now and the list is very long.

First I will list Search replacement, then Chrome replacements, then go through the other services you probably want to replace.

For the last item there are two major approaches I recommend - just switch to Apple iCloud, or replace individual services.

I will also give a short description of the company providing the service and then links.

## Replace Search

Most web browsers have a setting where you can select an alternative search provider. There are a few options availablle, but I only recommend one:
- DuckDuckGo - For profit company in the USA. Also an advertising company but highly ethical about it. No storing your searches, has some options to turn off AI nonsense.
  - <https://duckduckgo.com/>

## Replace Chrome

- Firefox - Mozilla is a not for profit, mostly funded by income from Search Partnerships. The Mozilla Project are where the first major web browser (Netscape) was written, and their mission has always been to support individual accessibility on an open Internet. Lots of good plugin support.

- Safari - Apple is a for profit global mega corporation (HQ in USA), most income is from hardware sales to end consumers. Only available on macOS / iOS, has good plugin architecture including ad blocking where the plugin does not get access to what you browse, very secure. If you use a Mac / iPhone / iPad this is the best option.

- Opera - For profit Company in Oslo, Norway. They are an advertising company but seem to be ethical about it.

- DuckDuckGo - For profit company in the USA. Also an advertising company but highly ethical about it. Also my recommendation for search.
  Does not have browser extensions.

## Replace Gmail/Gcal/Gdrive with Apple iCloud.com

I actually do use Apple and their iCloud services and recommend them. Almost the entirety of Apple revenue comes from end users buying their hardware and secondarily from icloud services, and as a result their motivation to keep your data secure and private is very high.

They have robust security and privacy embedded throughout their entire product suite as a result, including Advanced Data Protection for iCloud where they cannot access your data at all from their side, if you wish to turn that on.

Unfortunately that does comes at a cost of being inside their walled garden, and their hardware is a long way from the cheapest option (although their hardware is also supported for the longest time after release by a factor of about three).
