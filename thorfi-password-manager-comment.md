# Password Manager Standard Comment - Last updated Jan 2025 - thorfi

I have been strongly recommending 1Password for many years (I do tech security as a part of my professional work).

In my professional opinion there are four realistic options (that have been around for a long time and have a good reputation and which I have done serious research into) for anyone who is not up to researching the tech and security implications themselves:

- 1Password (best on the security front by a long way, many great features)
- Dashlane (newest one, but so far reliable, good features)
- Bitwarden (open source, less user friendly but OK, good personal free tier)
- Apple Passwords / iCloud Keychain (if you mainly use Apple devices and do not ever intend to change that, does have Windows support via iCloud Password)

For the more technical users you may wish to investigate KeePass (see KeePassXC for desktop, but there are a lot of other options as well for desktop and mobile), but being free open source there are support caveats: The different apps are all maintained by different people; you will need to know some technical stuff; lalala this is an open road motorcycle club; please consider wisely.

The other other solution is actually a physical Little Black Book - this is an actual serious possibility recommendation from some serious security professionals as well. It is hard to hack an actual book. But - it is hard to back up, it certainly has a higher risk of loss, and transporting it is a pain, etc.

P.S.: I used to recommend LastPass but they have had severe security breaches in 2022 that have not been well responded to. I recommend moving away from them.
